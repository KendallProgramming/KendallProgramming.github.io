## _Goals_
I have 5 main goals I want to achieve within the next few years
- Become good with stocks
- Become **much** better at programming than I am currently
- Reach greater heights with my body, physique wise and strength wise
- Gain an internship at a good tech company
- Continue dating my girlfriend/ possible proposal when college is over

## _Interests_
- My biggest interet is programming. I discovered that all computers ran on programs when I was 15, and ever since then, I've been on my journy to become a professional developer
- Right behind that is the gym. I love the gym and health related stuff in general. I'd like to find a way to combine my two main interests

## _Hobbies_
